As an outside user, I'd like to work on Exercise 5. To do so, I need to fork the repository --- this is like making my own branch to work on. To do this, I go to the repository I'd like to work on and click the fork button (in the menu on the top right part of the screen on the repo page). Github now makes a copy of this repository under my account. Now, I clone this forked repository onto my local machine. Now i can do some work on my local machine, do commits and push up to this forked repository. When I'm ready to submit this code back to the original user's repository I then will do a "Pull Request".
