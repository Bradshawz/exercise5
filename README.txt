For Exercise 5, you will need to:
	1) clone this repository
	2) Implement largest_box_subset in matryoshka_boxes.py using Dynamic 	
	Programming and Memoization --- for details on what largest_box_subset
	should do, look in the code. In general: look at the code. You may add any 
	additional functions you see fit. You may add functions to the box class
	as well.
	3) Commit your changes using git
	4) Use tar and zip up your entire working directory (including the .git 			
	directory that gets created when you clone the repo) and submit this on 
	eclass. We will be looking at your .git directory to make sure you have 	
	committed your changes to git, so please be sure you include this.
